                        “Motion in Fine Arts”: I love Cinematic Storytelling and I love film and short film creation the
                        idea of translating the aesthetics of fine arts into cinematic storytelling would captivate
                        myself
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This allows you to create a unique cinematic experience that stands at the intersection of
                        traditional and modern artistry
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I’ve done a few Motion Graphic related project, so I do have experience about how to create
                        visual effects and I would love to see how I can combine it with storytelling, this will be my
                        go-to
                        theme.

                        Water is a fundamental element of life, and its contamination and scarcity pose significant
                        threats to both the environment and human health. So, I want to tell a compelling visual story
                        that
                        encourages action and raises awareness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Especially with a lot of rivers are being contaminate in Vietnam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This theme will be a document video with cinematic visual and graphic. I’ve work on a few of my
                        personal project (short film) and I my biggest advantage is that I have all the equipment
                        needed for this project.

                    <li>
                        I do not have much experience about working on animation, I did however teach myself simple 2D
                        character animation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even this is a very interesting theme, I’ll have to discard it since I’m not very confidence
                        with my animation skill. We’re going with creating visual and document with camera instead.

                    <li>
                        Health and Livelihood Impact: Water pollution in rivers directly affects the health and
                        livelihoods of communities living nearby. Contaminated water sources can lead to waterborne
                        diseases
                        and health issues, affecting the overall well-being of individuals and communities. </li>

                        Critical issue of water pollution: Water pollution in rivers is a significant environmental
                        concern caused by discharging pollutants such as industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and
                        sewage into
                        river systems. These pollutants can contaminate the water, harm aquatic life, and affect human
                        health.
