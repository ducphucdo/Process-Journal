                    The To Lich River is a small river located in Hanoi, the
                    capital city of Vietnam. It flows through the western part of
                    Hanoi and is one of its many rivers and water bodies.
                    Historically, the To Lich River was once a picturesque and
                    clean waterway, but over the years, it has become heavily
                    polluted due to urbanization and industrial activities in the
                    area. I think this is the most famous polluted river in
                    Vietnam. We've had this problem for several years and still
                    have not yet found a solution.

                    Insufficient waste collection and treatment infrastructure
                    contribute to the problem. This includes inadequate
                    sewage systems, illegal dumping of garbage directly into the
                    river, and limited capacity for treating industrial waste.
                    Unauthorized construction and encroachment onto the
                    riverbanks have reduced the natural buffer zone, increasing
                    the vulnerability of the river to pollution.

                        Efforts have been made to clean
                        and restore the To Lich River to
                        its former state. In recent years,
                        the government and various
                        organizations in Hanoi have been
                        implementing environmental
                        projects to improve water quality
                        and rejuvenate the river. These
                        efforts include measures like
                        treating wastewater, planting
                        trees along the riverbanks, and
                        raising public awareness about
                        the importance of keeping the
                        river clean.

                        While these efforts are
                        encouraging, the To Lich River
                        remains heavily polluted.
                        Cleaning it up will require
                        sustained commitment from the
                        government, businesses, and
                        individuals to address all the
                        contributing factors.
